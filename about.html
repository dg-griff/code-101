            <p>This website is designed to be your one-stop guide to the Barbadian players who are members of the West Indies cricket team.</p>

        <p>
            The site was developed as part of the Code 101 Workshop hosted by Ten Habitat and Lead Instructor Dario Thornhill.
        </p>

        <p>
            The site was a collaborative effort among four team members. These are:
            <ul>
                <li>Damien Griffith (Project Lead)</li>
                <li>Maria-Elena Farmer</li>
                <li>Andre Thomas</li>
                <li>Damien Blackett</li>
            </ul>
